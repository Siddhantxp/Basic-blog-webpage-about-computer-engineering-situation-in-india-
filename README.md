# Computer Engineering Blog (Static CSS Website)

This repository is a lightweight static website scaffold (HTML + CSS + minimal JS) for a blog about *computer engineering situations in India*. It's built for easy deployment to GitHub Pages or any static-hosting provider.

- `about.html` — a simple about page
- `post-sample.html` — sample single-post layout
- `assets/` — placeholder folder for images (not included)
- `README.md` — this file

## How to use

1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g. `computer-engineering-india-blog`).
2. Copy the files from this scaffold into the repo.
3. Commit and push.
4. On GitHub, enable GitHub Pages (Settings → Pages → Source: `main` branch / root). The site will be available at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>`.

Alternatively, just open `index.html` locally in your browser for quick testing.

## Customization
